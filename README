== Simplified Breadcrumbs

A nice way to add breadcrumbs to your application. Antonio Cangiano posted a 
link in the Ruby on Rails weblog to a post which talked about adding breadcrumbs 
to your Rails application. I've been doing this with helpers, but as the post
says this is "Easy and flexible". So I've created the plugin.

== Example

  ##
  # app/controllers/application.rb
  #
  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

    add_breadcrumb 'Home', '/'

  end

  ##
  # app/controllers/things_controller.rb
  #
  class ThingsController < ApplicationController

    add_breadcrumb 'Things', :things_path
    add_breadcrumb 'Create a new thing', '', :only => [:new, :create]
    add_breadcrumb 'Edit a thing', '', :only => [:edit, :update]

    def show
      @thing = Thing.find(params[:id])
      add_breadcrumb @thing.name, ''
    end

  end

  ##
  # app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
  #
  <%= breadcrumb %>
  <%= breadcrumb("=>") %> <!-- You can define the separator you want -->
